# Simulation_using_spreading_model


In this simulation, we were trying to predict the deposition of misfolded protein (amyloid-beta) in regions of the brain of a patient using a mathematical spreading model (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003956). 
The data that we are using represents the connectomes of brains (connectivity matrix) which are adjacency matrices.
